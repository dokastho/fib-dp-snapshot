# fib-dp-snapshot

A very quick demonstration of Dynamic Programming. Using a 1D vector, you can get any n item in the fibonacci sequence in constant time with linear memory, as apposed to the recursive linear or even exponential time and constant memory.

In previous classes I've also made use of dynamic programming to reduce time cost for a travelling salseman problem, a knapsack problem and a punchcard problem.
